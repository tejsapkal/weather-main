##  Overview

The Weather App enables users to quickly check the current weather conditions of any city by entering its name in a search bar.  
It fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, displaying details such as temperature, weather description, and city name in a clean, responsive layout.

This project showcases:

- Integration with third-party APIs
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Responsive front-end development principles


##  Features

- **City-based search:** Enter any city name to get instant weather updates.
- **Real-time data:** Displays temperature, weather condition, and location details.
- **Responsive UI:** Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Fast & lightweight:** Minimal dependencies, pure HTML/CSS/JS stack.
- **API-powered:** Live data sourced from OpenWeatherMap


##  How It Works

1. The user enters a city name in the input field.
2. A `fetch()` call is made to the **OpenWeatherMap API** with that city name.
3. The app retrieves weather data in JSON format.
4. The relevant details are extracted and displayed dynamically in the UI.
5. If the city is not found, an error message is shown gracefully.
